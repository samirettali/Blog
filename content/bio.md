Hi, I'm Samir and I'm a Computer Science student living in Turin, Italy. I'm
deeply passionate about programming and hacking.

I play CTFs every now and then and I post my [writeups](/writeups) on the blog.
You can check some of the code I've written on my
[Github](https://github.com/samirettali) if you're interested.
