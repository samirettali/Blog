# My blog

This is the source code for my personal blog.

It was previously using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) but as I started doint web
development I switched to a stack that fits my needs.

It is currently built in typescript using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with
SSG, [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/)
for parsing markdown files and generating the HTML.

It is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with automatic deployments after
a push to Github.
